<h2>We are calling on Reading Borough Council to introduce secure on-street cycle hangars in Reading.</h2>

<h3>What is a cycle hangar?</h3>

<p>A cycle hangar is a secure metallic box designed to store multiple bicycles on the street in a residential setting. Cycle
    hangar places are usually controlled such that only those who pay a fee can unlock the hangar and keep their bike
    inside.</p>

<p>There are two models of bike hangar available today, the Cyclehoop, which looks like this:</p>

<p>and the FalcoPod, which looks like this:</p>

<h3>Where do you want them installed?</h3>

<p>Reading has a number of historic Victorian terraced neighbourhoods consisting of small two-story houses and multi-storey
    blocks of flats. We believe cycle hangars would be ideal for these neighbourhoods.</p>

<h3>Why can’t people just keep their bikes indoors or in their gardens?</h3>

<p>The main reason is a lack of space. A typical Victorian terraced house has 60 - 70 sqm of floor area (650 - 750 sqft). A
   single bike, yet alone two or three (for houses of multiple occupancy) can take up the same space as a sofa. For the same
   reason, it can be very inconvenient to have to wheel a bike through to the back garden. Some Victorian houses have
   sufficient space in the front to install a bike locker, but many do not. We also note that two-bike lockers start at around
   £700, which adds a significant barrier to bicycle uptake for low income residents.</p>

<p>For flat conversions, the dominant housing type in the Russell Street/Castle Hill area for example, a garden may be
    accessible, but tenants rely on the proactiveness of the landlord to provide a secure storage solution - a quality notably
    lacking among private landlords. On the other hand, in order to keep a bike in their flat, tenants would have to carry
    their bike up one or more flights of stairs, which they may not be physically capable of doing.</p>

<p>The #ThisIsAwkward campaign in London highlighted the absurd lengths people will go to to store their bikes safely. This
    problem also exists in Reading.</p>

<h3>Won't the introduction of cycle hangars mean removing parking spaces?</h3>

<p>If they are introduced widely, yes, some car parking space will be removed. However, given that one car parking space can
   accommodate six bikes, we think it’s only fair to give residents a choice over how their street space is allocated. Of
   course, this should be subject to consultation, and we believe the case is strong enough to receive democratic support.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are spaces where cycle hangars could be introduced without sacrificing a parking space. We believe there
    are enough of these spaces to allow for a pilot scheme of 10-20 hangars throughout the Borough. For example, Body Road,
    Amity Street, South Street, and De Montford Road all have spaces that are ideal for a hangar or two (will show
    pictures).</p>

<h3>Who will pay for them?</h3>

<p>As with all matters of local authority investment, this is a difficult question. Future rounds of the Active Travel
    Fund (for which the council has a successful track record) could be one source. Another could be a fund paid by
    local developers, or the Community Infrastructure Levy. We appreciate that there is no guarantee of funding for this
    scheme in the short term, but still believe the council should draw up plans now so that they can be ready when the
    time is right.</p>

<h3>Do cycle hangars exist elsewhere in the UK?</h3>

<p>Yes! Cycle hangars can be seen all over London nowadays. There are also schemes in Edinburgh, Glasgow, York, Dundee,
    Bath, Brighton, Oxford, Sheffield, and Bristol. We note that all of these cities have similar housing stock to Reading.</p>

<h3>Aren’t cycle hangars a bit ugly?</h3>

<p>It’s true that cycle hangars have quite a utilitarian design, and have upset some people in historic areas. We simply
   note that they are no worse than the parked cars which already dominate the streetscapes of the neighbourhoods we are
   talking about. A cycle hangar is no less in keeping with the character of the local street than a typical SUV, for example.
   Some would even say that they look quite cool…</p>

<h3>Isn’t the council already building a secure cycle storage hub in the town centre?</h3>

<p>Reading Borough Council has plans for a “cycle hub” somewhere in the town centre, for storing about 80 bikes in a secure,
   guarded location. They originally planned to lease an old shop until the owners, Primark, suddenly pulled out without
   reason. We hope the council can find an alternative location. Still, given that the cycle hub will only be open from
   7AM - 7PM, this is a solution for commuters and shoppers, not those living locally. Both types of storage are important
   for building a cycle-friendly town.</p>
